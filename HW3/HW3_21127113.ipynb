    "We start by arguing that any point configuration with **more than $3$ points** and that can be shattered by a triangle **must be composed of points that lay along a convex hull**. Otherwise, we can trivially generate dichotomies that cannot be separated by taking the convex hull of these points, assigning $+1$ to points that are on the convex hull, and $-1$ to points that are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that out of the way, it is not hard to see that separating points along a convex hull with a triangle reduces to $3$-intervals with a twist: namely, that the \"last\" point becomes adjacent to the first, so that sets with $7$ points can now be shattered (Fig. \\@ref(fig:triangle-shatter)(a)).\n",

We will demonstrate that if $x_1$ and $x_2$ are red, then either: _i)_ $x_3$ is also red, or _ii)_ $x_3$ is not a part of a the convex hull. Either way, an $8$-point set cannot be shattered with a triangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof.** Suppose we wanted our newly-added $x_3$ point to be blue. We must therefore place $x_3$ outside of the decision triangle. However, since the interior angles in a convex hull cannot be larger than $180^{\\circ}$, it must be the case that $x_3$ is contained within the small orange triangle of Fig. \\@ref(fig:triangle-shatter)(b). That small triangle, however, is entirely composed of red points as it lays entirely within our decision triangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get $x_3$ to be blue, therefore, we must make it so that the decision triangle intercepts the orange triangle, leaving at least one point out for us to pick as our $x_3$ while keeping, of course, all of the other points as they are. \n",
    "\n",
    "But we see that this is not possible. Informally: in order to intercept the orange triangle while keeping $x_1$ and $x_2$ inside, we must \"squash\" the decision triangle so much that we also also scoop both $x_5$ and $x_6$ in, turning them red (Fig. \\@ref(fig:triangle-shatter)(c)). It therefore follows that either $x_3$ must be red, or it must be outside of the convex hull. The $8$-point set cannot be shattered. $\\blacksquare$\n",
